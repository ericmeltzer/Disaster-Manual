# Survival Medicine & First Aid

Hi Becky,

I pasted the style guide from the job listing so you'll be able to refer to that easily. One additional thing:

-Please write the draft in a text editor that does plaintext, rather than in Microsoft Word. Text editor, notepad etc are all fine. The final book will be formatted using Markdown, so the page and paragraph breaks that word inserts will be annoying to deal with.

In markdown, chapter title headings have a # in front of them:

#Chapter Title

and subject titles have two of them ##

##Subject Title

You can do bulleted lists with hyphens like this:

-first item
-second item
-third item

Thats pretty much it.

Research sources for this: http://en.hesperian.org/hhg/New_Where_There_Is_No_Doctor:Chapter_3:_First_Aid is an EXCELLENT source, but requires a lot of rephrasing and condensing.

Please crossreference that against Chapter 4 of the army survival guide PDF I attached.


Style, content & sourcing guide

1. Citations should look like this (1)(http://thesiteyouareciting.com) or if it's printed material, (1)(the name of the printed material). We'll clean the cites up later into a footnotes section, but for now that is ALL that's required.

2. When in doubt, CITE. Over-cite if necessary. I'm sure this goes without saying, but just to avoid any confusion, never copy anything directly from the source materials. If you want to quote from the source material if it's particularly well phrased on a topic, feel free to do so but keep the quotes short. Any giant block quotes should be rewritten in original language.

3. Prefer common words over uncommon ones, and simple language over jargon.

4. Refer to the sample chapter for formatting questions, headers, etc.

5. Favor speed over perfect phrasing. We have a really great editor on staff, so it's better to write more than to worry about each sentence too much.

6. Only include actionable information, minimize background info that is interesting but isn't directly usable by people in a disaster situation.

7. Use the PDF's I sent you as sources, and also Google for additional source material. For the sample chapter on disaster psychology I sent the first few google hits for "disaster psychology" were very useful CDC papers, for example.
